# api-weather-dashboard

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a weather dashboard, that will show the current weather as well as a forecast for the next 5 days for a city a user will type in the search field. The search inputs are saved and user will be able to access his previous search results. To obtain weather information the API of OpenWeather was used.
Working on this project, I gained further understanding of working with API, fetching data, and displaying it on a webpage.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

When the user opens the application, they will see an input field where they can type in the city they would like to check the weather in. Once they click on the search button, they will see the current weather in the requested city, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, as well as an icon demonstrating the weather conditions. In addition, the user will see the same info for the next 5 days. Once clicked on the search button, every search input will be saved on a separate button and by clicking on it the user will be able to see the weather results for that city.
